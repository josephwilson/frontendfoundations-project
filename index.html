                <h1>Welcome To Joe's Car Dealership!</h1><hr>

                <p>Joe's Car Dealership has been family owned and serving the wonderful people of Phoenix for 3 generations! Over the years we've built a reputation for giving people a fair deal. With so many dealerships all over Phoenix we would be out of business if we were ripping people off.</p> 
                <p>We know that buying a car can be scary, you never really know if you're getting a fair deal or not. At Joe's Car Dealership we make every offer plain and clear and in large print so you know exactly what's you're paying for. Every offer includes:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The price we paid for the car, what we've spent getting it ready for you.</li>

                    <li>Any amount you might be getting in credit for any vehicle you might be traing in.</li>

                    <li>What we're charging on top of our cost, generally 20% if it's not a special vehicle like a collectors item or a car from a movie. This is the amount that goes to pay the salesman, keep the lights on and feed my family.</li>

                    <li>Any fees or taxes going to good old Uncle Sam. Yes, I know, taxation is theft, but we don't pay Uncle Sam he'll send his thugs to shoot us in the face.</li>

                    <li>Who you're financed with (unless you lined up your own financing, that's fine too, less paperwork for me!), what your interest rate is, how many payments you'll make and your total final cost on the vehicle.</li>
                </ol>

                <aside>
                    <p>At Joe's Car Dealership we don't pay the salesman a percentage based commission and we dont'negotiate (unless it's one of those previously mentioned special cars).</p>
                    
                    <p>This is how we create a friendly environment, the salesman is incentivised to get you what you want without any funny business. The salesman are paid a flat rate per car, which means it's in their best interest to be nice to you and find you something you like and quickly instead of trying to push you around or confuse you.</p>
                </aside>

                <p>If that's not enough, the offer is good for a week. We call that the "sleep on it" policy. We do require a $500 deposit for this part, just to make sure you're serious and we're not taking a car off of the lot for some tire kicker. My goal though is to make sure you're comfortable and happy with your purchase so you'll come back and do business with us again.</p>

                <p>Every car that's purchased at Joe's Car Dealership gets 4 free maintenance sessions which include:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Tire rotation</li>
                    <li>Air Intake Filter</li>
                    <li>Oil Change</li>
                    <li>Inspection</li>
                </ol>

                <p>Joe's Car Dealership will pay you to tell your friends about us! If you send a friend over we'll give you both a $250 gas card! We can afford to do this because if enough people are sending their friends and family members to us then we don't have to advertise so it's not really an expense for us.</p>

                <p>If you're sufficiently satisfied that you should be doing business with us, please head over to the inventory page and see what we've got in stock for you! Inventory is updated every night and if you're looking for something specific we can definitely keep an eye out for you so just let us know and we will!</li>
